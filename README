Bud Davis CFB Opponent Adjusted Stats

If you find this method useful or use it often, please cite my code

Overview:
- Adjustment on PBP-level Data
  - Not garbage time filtered
- Method of adjustment is Ridge Regression
  - Method inspired from
    - https://medium.com/analyzing-ncaa-college-basketball-with-gcp/fitting-it-in-adjusting-team-metrics-for-schedule-strength-4e8239be0530
    - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13L4b36cTrnC55ahD6dVf4-r9pzkYV-j5
- Joint adjustment for
  - Homefield advantage
  - Offense quality
  - Defense quality
  
More Details:
- Function: epa = intercept + offense_team + defense_team + homefield advantage
- Every team gets offense and defense dummy variables
- Homefield advantage also gets a dummy variable
- Ridge solves for the value of these dummy variables jointly in one go (no iterative averaging)
- Ridge over general linear model since, Ridge has a penalty term to avoid overfitting 
- We solve for this penalty term via cross validation of the season data to date
- Ridge is better than Lasso since we explicitly want a value for every dummy variable
